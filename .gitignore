# **Important**
#
# You might tempted to move some of those inside their respective sub-folder,
# but do NOT do that! Keep everything in this top-level `.gitignore` because it
# is used by `gcloud` command (specially in `.gcloudignore` here) to ignore
# files.
#
# And if you modified this `.gitignore`, please also check that the `gcloud`
# is not including big files.
#
# Check with `gcloud meta list-files-for-upload | xargs -n1 du -sh`
