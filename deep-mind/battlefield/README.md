## EOS Smart Contract Boilerplate

### Building

#### Docker

The docker steps still uses the EOS.IO CDT, wrapped in a Docker container provided
to you by EOS Canada 🇨🇦.

To build the contract using this method, simply do:

```
./build.sh
```

#### EOS.IO CDT

If you have the EOS.IO CDT SDK available on your machine directly, simply do only the compile step
instead:

```
./compile.sh
```
